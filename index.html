    I have many hobbies. Such as drawing, painting, playing intruments, the violin and the giutar, I also enjoy cooking oraganising things. I draw and sketch things like flowers, obejects and animals and humens. In my school we learn how to play the violin and i am farley good at it. I also used to take guitar classes, guitar and the violin and very diffrent but also very similar. If you know how to play the guitar, playing the violin would be easeir to play.
